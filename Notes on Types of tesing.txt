There are 4 types of testing, one for each level and each with their own test plan
> Unit testing
	execution of a complete class, routine or small program that has been written by a single programmer or team of programmers, which is tested in isolation from the more complete system.
	tests smallest components (code)
> Integration testing
	the combined execution of two or more classes, packages, components, or subsystems that have been created by multiple programmers or programming teams.
	reveal interface problems as well as conflicts between integrated parts.
> System testing
	the execution of the software in its final configuration, including integration with other software and hardware systems.
	tests for security, performance, resource loss, timing problems, and other issues
> Acceptance testing
	Beta Testing is the equivalent of Acceptance testing as the final end-users who will buy the game are involved in the testing.
	evaluate and validate that the system’s functionality meets the customer’s requirements, standards and business needs before the final delivery.


Questions_
- Unit testing is testing isolated parts of the software components like code, classes and routines etc.
- It is conducted by the developer
- it is whitebox testing

- Integration testing is testing multiple parts of the software together to check of compatability issues and conflicts.
- it is simulated 
- It can be both types.
